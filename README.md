# FuncProg1
Meant for depositing functional programming assignments. Since I have no idea how GitHub works, I have no idea if each assignment will have its own repository or not. Wait and see.

I'm making this repository public as I see no way to create a "secret" link akin to the mechanism in Soundcloud. If you're not the person evaluating my assignment, look away.
