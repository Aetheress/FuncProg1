# FuncProg1
Meant for depositing functional programming assignments. Since I have no idea how GitHub works, I have no idea if each assignment will have its own repository or not. Wait and see.

I'm making this repository public as I see no way to create a "secret" link akin to the mechanism in Soundcloud. If you're not the person evaluating my assignment, look away.

The program has been modified so that the divisor checking range is limited to 1..sqrt(n). The if-else if-else construction has also been replaced by using lists of boolean values and a map, where each list equates to a state - TFF for deficient, FTF for perfect, FFT for abundant. Highly likely that there's a more convenient way of implementing the map but I could come up with no such way.
